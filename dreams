THis project could be even better


1. run an IOS app that allows easy sharing to the clipboard.
2. Allow anyting to send images to your clipboard (if you allow)
3. Add some kind of security lol.
4. Just make the UI a bit nicer
5. Some kind of installer for starting if you are using linux. easy setup
6. Since its a CLI focus app that should create the share link? or easier would be login to webapp and
7. somehow see it there. (cli logs you in and creates link.)
